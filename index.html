        <h2>Starville Contracting – A Specialist in Construction Services</h2>
        <p>At Starville Contracting, construction is more than just a business—it’s a family legacy. With over 60 years of combined experience, our roots in the building trade trace back to the owner's grandfather, who laid the foundation for what would become a multi-generational commitment to quality, craftsmanship, and hard work.
        </p>
        <p>Today, we carry that legacy forward with a modern approach and a highly skilled team of tradesmen who take pride in every project. Specialising in brickwork, dry lining, tiling, and painting & decorating, we provide a full range of construction services to residential developers, commercial contractors, and private clients across the UK.
        </p>
        <p>What sets us apart is our hands-on ethos, our attention to detail, and our deep understanding of the construction process from the ground up. Whether it’s building solid structures with precision brickwork, transforming interiors with flawless dry lining, adding beauty and durability through expert tiling, or completing spaces with premium painting and decorating—we deliver reliable results with a personal touch.
        </p>
        <p> Our clients trust us not only for our experience and expertise but for our transparency, professionalism, and commitment to doing things right the first time. At Starville Contracting, we don’t just build—we build with pride, integrity, and passion passed down through generations.
